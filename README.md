# Container in depth

This repository contains resources, guides, user journeys and information to help understand containers at a low level better.

## Contents

* [cgroups](cgroups.md)
* namespaces
* chroot


## Roadmap

This readme and the contents of this repository are still a work in progress - bear with me as I add more :-)
